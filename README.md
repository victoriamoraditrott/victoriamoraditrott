👋 Hi, I’m @victoriamoraditrott

My main aim save money ensure my 4 children
have the best start in life. 

If am able to save money one place
means each child gets those little extras!! 💝 

I totally buzz seeing there little faces totally priceless memories 

But I want to help other out there who 
don't have endless pots of money but can still
Keep up with the up and coming trends. 

My total nightmare is there a new series out! 
Never just one there's new out on every
Range and brand for what you get isn't over priced and 
Us parents left either buying stupid amounts and never
Getting there full set of even the one other children wanted.

My aim is to refuse paying full price on anything and everything!!

As the saying goes if you look after the penies, 
The pounds will look after themselves! 

Plus I just love shopping so yous really just my excuse
to spend more hours searching but am been honest man! 🤩

Am sure I'll find some treasures along the way so yous
Will forgive amd probably join me buying more rubbish
because it seems to good not to!!

I dont think I will ever learn from the clutter
endless parcles you order months ago Nd totally
forgotten about! My excuses anyways..
